# Genetic Algorithm Polynomial Solver

This project provides an interactive web application built with **Streamlit** to solve polynomial equations using a **genetic algorithm**. It dynamically supports quadratic, cubic, and higher-degree equations, allowing users to input custom coefficients and visualize the solution process.

## Features
- **Degree Selection**: Choose the degree of the polynomial (e.g., quadratic, cubic, etc.).
- **Dynamic Coefficient Input**: Input coefficients for terms dynamically based on the degree.
- **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**: Solves the polynomial by maximizing the fitness function over generations.
- **Visualization**: Displays fitness progression over iterations through a line chart.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for ease of use and accessibility.
